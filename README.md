# New Zealand Crime Prediction

This repository contains a project for predicting crime in New Zealand using data-driven approaches, machine learning, and statistical analysis.

## Overview

Crime prediction models aim to analyze historical crime data to forecast potential crime hotspots and trends. Such predictive systems can help in improving public safety, resource allocation, and informed decision-making for law enforcement agencies.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and visualization for New Zealand crime datasets.
- Machine Learning models for crime prediction.
- Evaluation metrics and results visualization.
- Example notebooks and scripts for experimentation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Basuru12/Newzealand-Crime-Prediction.git
   cd Newzealand-Crime-Prediction
   ```

2. Install required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset as specified in the data/ directory or the README documentation within `data/`.
2. Run the analysis or model training scripts:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   or explore the Jupyter notebooks for step-by-step workflow.
